# Naturalis timeviewbox downloader

Setup
---
1. Create a folder named Downloads
2. Create a folder named temp inside this Downloads folder
3. Run the downloader.php file (preferable from a command line)

Usage
---
When this script is ran it will download 1 image from ~12:00. You can modify the code to download more of the images or a different image for each day. Eventually I plan to add more features allowing for arguments from the command line to set these things, eliminating the need for changing the code to achieve these goals.

What is this for?
---
This script was created as a tool to automatically download one or multiple images per day. This is planned to be used to create a timelaps video. It might be useful for other things too. This code should work on other timeviewbox projects as well, but I haven't looked into those and as such also have not tested it with anythings apart from Naturalis.
